Sabanc覺 University outgoing website has some functionalities.
One of them is listing courses which are acceptable by Sabanc覺 University. When students
want to take a course from another university in the exchange program, they check whether
this course accepted before. This system lists the courses and their equivalent at Sabanc覺
University. The second functionality is sending request to make the course equivalent. If there
is no equivalent of the course, students are able to send request to create an equivalent of this
course. Another functionality is that students are able to fill learning agreement using this
system.

This system will have equal_courses, universities, req_page, add_drop, learning agreement,
users, mail_log databases.
